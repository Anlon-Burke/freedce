======================================
FreeDCE RPC and DCOM Toolkit for Linux
======================================

This package provides support for developing DCE RPC and Microsoft RPC
applications on the Linux platform. The source code and binaries are
freely-redistributable provided you maintains the copyright notice of the
source components.

This package could be ported to other platforms as well, provided that you can
implement the semantics of the DCE Exceptions and DCE Threads on the target
platforms' thread layer.

FreeDCE for Linux relies on GNU Libc 2.x and LinuxThreads Pthreads.  DCE
Threads and DCE Exceptions are emulated using LinuxThreads, allowing for
multithreaded RPC client and server applications to coexist with other
threaded and non-threaded library components in the LInux development
environment.

Inventory of Goods:
-------------------
* OSF DCE 1.1 IDL compiler
* DCE RPC runtime and development libraries/headers
* `uuid' tool for generating and manipulating DCE UUIDs
* rpcd - the host endpoint mapper for DCE RPC applications
* Performance, Interoperabilit and Functionality test suite
* some demonstration code for writing clients and servers

Prerequisites:
-------------

Pretty much everything will need to be the "latest versions".
For example, at time of writing, you will likely need a 2.6 kernel
with NPTL.  You will need glibc6 version 2.3.2.  You will need Flex
2.5.31, you will need automake 1.9, you will need autoconf 2.53.
I think that's about it :)

The only exception to this general rule is: don't for pity's sake
use gcc 4, it has much stricter rules and FreeDCE has always been
built with -Wall (see include.mk if you absolutely _must_ switch
this off).

Guidelines for gentoo developers: gentoo doesn't build properly
with Flex 2.5.31, therefore it is excluded from gentoo.  This is
rather stupid, because the version of flex that is used to build
gentoo has nothing to do with the version of flex that you need
to use for development purposes.  As gentoo merge these two totally
separate purposes into one (You Must Use The Same Version Of Flex
For Building Gentoo As Actual Development) you will need to obtain
the source code for flex 2.5.31 and build it _separately_
(./configure --prefix=/opt/local) , then specify
FLEX=/opt/local/bin/flex ./configure .... when building freedce.
Sorry.  tough luck.  Debian gets round this by having the
build requirements separate from development requirements,
and each package is typically built in its own debootstrap
chrooted environment (!)

How to Build:
-------------
This package uses autoconf, so `say' the following at a prompt:

 % ./configure
 % make
 % su
 # make install

Note that things will install in /opt/dce by default. To change this, pass the
--prefix argument to configure.

What the install process doesn't do is arrange for the rpcd to run at startup;
check out the rc.dce-clean and rc.dcerpcd scripts and install them: for RedHat
use a set of commands like this:

 # ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc.dcerpcd /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K30dcerpcd
 # ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc.dce-clear /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S60dce-clean
 # ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc.dcerpcd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S61dcerpcd

You might also need to add /opt/dce/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf

How to build your own programs that use DCE RPC
-----------------------------------------------

CFLAGS+=-D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE
LDFLAGS+= -ldcethreads -lpthread
If you are using the uuid library, you will also need:
LDFLAGS+= -luuid -lstdc++

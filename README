======================================
FreeDCE RPC and DCOM Toolkit for Linux
======================================

This package provides support for developing DCE RPC and Microsoft RPC
applications on the Linux platform. The source code and binaries are
freely-redistributable provided you maintains the copyright notice of the
source components.

This package could be ported to other platforms as well, provided that you can
implement the semantics of the DCE Exceptions and DCE Threads on the target
platforms' thread layer.

FreeDCE for Linux relies on GNU Libc 2.x and LinuxThreads Pthreads.  DCE
Threads and DCE Exceptions are emulated using LinuxThreads, allowing for
multithreaded RPC client and server applications to coexist with other
threaded and non-threaded library components in the LInux development
environment.

Inventory of Goods:
-------------------
* OSF DCE 1.1 IDL compiler
* DCE RPC runtime and development libraries/headers
* `uuid' tool for generating and manipulating DCE UUIDs
* rpcd - the host endpoint mapper for DCE RPC applications
* Performance, Interoperabilit and Functionality test suite
* some demonstration code for writing clients and servers

How to Build:
-------------
This package uses autoconf, so `say' the following at a prompt:

 % ./configure
 % make
 % su
 # make install

Note that things will install in /opt/dce by default. To change this, pass the
--prefix argument to configure.

What the install process doesn't do is arrange for the rpcd to run at startup;
check out the rc.dce-clean and rc.dcerpcd scripts and install them: for RedHat
use a set of commands like this:

 # ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc.dcerpcd /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K30dcerpcd
 # ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc.dce-clear /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S60dce-clean
 # ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc.dcerpcd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S61dcerpcd

You might also need to add /opt/dce/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf

How to build your own programs that use DCE RPC
-----------------------------------------------

CFLAGS+=-D_REENTRANT _GNU_SOURCE
LDFLAGS+= -ldcethreads -lpthread
If you are using the uuid library, you will also need:
LDFLAGS+= -luuid -lstdc++

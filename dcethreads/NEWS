Version 2:0:0 -> 2:1:0

	By Miroslaw Dobrzanski-Neumann
	* shorten commandline options by introducing autoheader support
	* all needed defines are in dce/dcethreads_conf.h
	  which is included by all header files. This guaranties that
	  _REENTRANT and _GNU_SOURCE are always defined.
	* dce/dcethreads_conf.h.in gets installed to
	  this allows the rpm builder to automatically adjust the
	  dce/dcethreads_conf.h at rpm installation time
	
Version 1:1 -> 2:0:0

	By Miroslaw Dobrzanski-Neumann
	* dce atfork() implemented
	  because we claim the binary compatibility between both standatds
	  pthread_atfork() has been reimplemented to work with dce atfork()
	* pthread_atfork() is not available in dce context
	* including <dce/exc_handling.h> disables most pthread_* calls
	  unless you include either <dce/pthread.h> or <dce/pthread_exc.h>
